# Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend

## 📚 Introduction to Project Requirements
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application.The requirements outlined below are categorized into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements.

## 🔑 Core Functionalities
The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

### 1. User Management
#### User Registration:
- Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
- Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
#### User Login and Authentication:
- Implement login via email and password.
- Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
#### Profile Management:
Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.
### 2. Property Listings Management
#### Add Listings:
Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
#### Edit/Delete Listings:
Hosts can update or remove their property listings.
### 3. Search and Filtering
#### Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
- Location
- Price range
- Number of guests
- Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
- Include pagination for large datasets.
### 4. Booking Management
#### Booking Creation:
- Guests can book a property for specified dates.
- Prevent double bookings using date validation.

#### Booking Cancellation:
Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
#### Booking Status:
Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.
### 5. Payment Integration
#### Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
- Upfront payments by guests.
- Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
- Include support for multiple currencies.
### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.
### 7. Notifications System
- Implement email and in-app notifications for:
- Booking confirmations
- Cancellations
- Payment updates
### 8. Admin Dashboard
#### Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
- Users
- Listings
- Bookings
- Payments

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements
### 1. Database Management
Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

#### Required tables:
- Users (guests and hosts)
- Properties
- Bookings
- Reviews
- Payments

### 2. API Development
Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
#### Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
- GET (retrieve data)
- POST (create data)
- PUT/PATCH (update data)
- DELETE (remove data)
- Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
Use JWT for secure user sessions.
#### Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
- Guests
- Hosts
- Admins

### 4. File Storage (Scenario based)
Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage
### 5. Third-Party Services
Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.
### 6. Error Handling and Logging
Implement global error handling for APIs.
## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements
### 1. Scalability
Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.
### 2. Security
Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.
### 3. Performance Optimization
Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
Optimize database queries to reduce server load.
### 4. Testing
Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected
